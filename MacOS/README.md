### About
This shortcut is a 1-Click and Siri Command solution for quickly toggling your AirPods connection on a Mac.

Why?
> I grew tired of my devices competing for the connection. When sitting down at the computer, I wished I could just quickly lock-in the connection while I worked.

### Recommended Setup

1. Connect AirPods & access their settings from `System Settings`
   1. Set Connect to this Mac to `When last connected to this mac`
   2. Copy the name of your AirPods (You'll need to past this in the shortcut)

#### Create A Keyboard Shortcut 
If you like keyboard shortcuts as much as I do, you can easily record your own keyboard shortcut that will run this Shortcut. Even pin it to your Menu Bar if you'd like.
